### Data Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: 100% data availability with no missing values
- **Consistency**: Uniform data structure across time periods  
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive 5-year historical period

### Statistical Properties

**Descriptive Statistics:**
- Mean: 52.25 units
- Median: 47.00 units  
- Standard Deviation: 28.80 units
- Skewness: 0.867 (moderate right skew)
- Kurtosis: 0.509 (slightly platykurtic)
- Range: 0-231 units

### Distribution Characteristics

1. **Right-Skewed Distribution**: The sales data exhibits moderate positive skewness, indicating that most observations cluster in the lower range with a tail extending toward higher values.

2. **Normality Assessment**: Shapiro-Wilk test (sample n=5,000): statistic=0.9844, p-value=1.43e-38, strongly rejecting the null hypothesis of normality.

3. **Transformation Effectiveness**: Log(sales+1) transformation successfully normalizes the distribution, as evidenced by improved Q-Q plot alignment and reduced skewness.

4. **Outlier Presence**: Box plot analysis reveals numerous outliers above 150 units, representing approximately 0.8% of observations.

### Statistical Implications
- Non-parametric methods may be more appropriate for certain analyses
- Log transformation recommended for normality-dependent modeling techniques
- Outlier treatment strategies should be considered based on model requirements

## 11. Data Preprocessing Recommendations

### Transformation Requirements
1. **Normality**: Log(sales+1) transformation recommended for parametric methods
2. **Scaling**: Standardization required for distance-based algorithms
3. **Outlier Treatment**: Consider separate modeling or robust methods
4. **Missing Values**: None present, no imputation needed

### Feature Engineering Opportunities
1. **Lag Features**: Sales from previous 1-7 days show correlation r=0.15-0.35
2. **Rolling Statistics**: 7-day and 30-day moving averages capture trend
3. **Seasonal Features**: Fourier terms for annual and weekly cycles
4. **Interaction Terms**: Store×Item, Month×Store, Item×Season

### Validation Considerations
- **Temporal Split**: Chronological validation essential due to time dependency
- **Store Stratification**: Ensure representation across performance tiers
- **Seasonal Coverage**: Validation sets should span complete seasonal cycles

## 12. Statistical Modeling Implications

### Model Suitability Assessment

**Linear Models:**
- Require log transformation due to non-normality
- Heteroscedasticity present, consider robust standard errors
- Strong seasonal patterns suggest need for seasonal features

**Tree-Based Models:**
- Can handle non-normal distributions naturally
- Effective for capturing store-item interactions
- May struggle with temporal dependencies without explicit features

**Time Series Models:**
- SARIMA appropriate given seasonality and stationarity
- State space models could handle multiple seasonalities
- Prophet-style models suitable for business context

### Cross-Validation Strategy
**Recommended Approach:**
- Time series split with expanding window
- Minimum 365 days in validation set for seasonal coverage
- Gap of 30 days between train/validation to prevent leakage

**Performance Metrics:**
- RMSE for overall accuracy assessment
- MAPE for interpretability and business relevance
- Seasonal MAPE for season-specific evaluation
